# checkly_client_certificate (Resource)

Use client certificates to authenticate your API checks to APIs that require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, or any other authentication scheme where the requester needs to provide a certificate.

Each client certificate is specific to a domain name, e.g. `acme.com` and will be used automatically by any API checks targeting that domain.

Changing the value of any attribute forces a new resource to be created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "acme_client_certificate_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

resource "checkly_client_certificate" "test" {
  host        = "*.acme.com"
  certificate = file("${path.module}/cert.pem")
  private_key = file("${path.module}/key.pem")
  trusted_ca  = file("${path.module}/ca.pem")
  passphrase  = var.acme_client_certificate_passphrase
}
```
